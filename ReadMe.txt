After launching Palworld Save Angel, you will be greeted with a user-friendly interface designed for easy navigation and configuration.

Select Backup Interval:
Locate the dropdown menu labeled "Backup Interval" on the main screen.
Choose from predefined intervals (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) to set how often the tool automatically saves backups of your game progress.
This setting ensures that your game progress is regularly backed up without any further input, providing peace of mind and data security.
Manual Backup
The "Backup Now" feature allows you to manually initiate a backup process at any moment, giving you additional control over your save data.

Initiate Backup:
Click the "Backup Now" button located prominently on the interface.
Upon clicking, Palworld Save Angel will immediately start creating a backup of your current game state, regardless of the scheduled automatic backup intervals.
This feature is particularly useful before making significant decisions or changes in your game, ensuring you have a recent save point to return to if needed.
Restore a Backup
Restoring your game to a previous state is straightforward with Palworld Save Angel. This process can be invaluable if you encounter game-breaking bugs, data corruption, or if you simply wish to return to an earlier point in your game.

Select a Backup:

The interface lists all your saved backups, each with a timestamp and potentially a custom name if you've renamed them.
Browse through the list and select the backup you wish to restore.
Restore Process:

Click the "Restore" button after selecting your desired backup.
Palworld Save Angel will confirm your choice, asking you to verify that you wish to overwrite the current game state with the selected backup.
Once confirmed, the tool will proceed to restore your game to the chosen backup's state, effectively rolling back your game progress to that point.

Manage Backups
Efficiently managing your backups ensures that you maintain only the necessary save points, helping to declutter your backup storage and keep it organized.

Review Backup List:

The main interface shows all your backups in a list, where you can easily review them.
Rename Backups:

To rename a backup, select it from the list and choose the "Rename" option.
Enter the new name for your backup to help you identify it later easily. This is particularly useful for marking significant game milestones or decisions.
Delete Unwanted Backups:

If you have backups you no longer need, you can select them from the list and press the "Delete" button.
